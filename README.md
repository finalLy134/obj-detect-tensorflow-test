# Object Detection with TensorFlow and tkinter

This project demonstrates real-time object detection using a TensorFlow model integrated into a tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

- **Object Detection** 📷: Detects objects in images using a pre-trained TensorFlow model.
- **GUI Interface** 🖼️: Simple tkinter GUI for selecting and analyzing images.
- **Bounding Box Visualization** 🎯: Draws bounding boxes and labels around detected objects.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x 🐍
- TensorFlow 2.x 🧠
- tkinter 🖥️
- OpenCV 📸
- Pillow (PIL) 🖼️

## Installation

   Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/finalLy134/obj-detect-tensorflow-test.git
   cd obj-detect-tensorflow-test
   ```
   
## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Click on "Choose Image" to browse and select an image file (supports JPG, JPEG, PNG).

3. The application will analyze the selected image and display the results with detected objects highlighted by bounding boxes.
